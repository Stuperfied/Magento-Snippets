[Importing New Images]

Only .jpg images may be imported.
The Small_Image field relates to the main image.
Small_Image always imports second.
Names should be lower case.
Image URL's requre a leading '/'.
New Values specified must have a corresponding file in /media/import.
Import will duplicate images if re-used.

[Including existing images in the .csv]
Existing Values export with their path. This path may be included when importing.
Existing Values specified in the .csv will be ignored.
Path is required for existing values as products with null field values are skipped.


[Notes]
A script has been added to allow the use of a "gallery" field. Images
added using this field should be seperated by a semicolon and located in
the media/import folder.

To avoid file not found errors, after importing, values should be 
removed from the "gallery" field.

To add labels for gallery images, once uploaded they may be removed
from the gallery field and cycled through "small_image", "image" and "thumbnail".

Fields include in an import must have a value or will be written blank. There
are a few exceptions such as in the case of images.
